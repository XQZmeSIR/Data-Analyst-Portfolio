Conclusion: Based on the diagram, we can conclude that **N-day retention** decreases dramatically. Nearly 80% of users churned after the first day. Following this rapid decline, there was a slight spike in activity, possibly due to a marketing campaign (ads), but the user retention continued to decrease overall.

To address this issue, the product/app needs to focus on improving initial user engagement and providing ongoing value. Strategies to consider include:

- Improving the onboarding experience: Make the initial setup and first-time use more intuitive and rewarding.
- Highlighting key features: Ensure users quickly discover and understand the core benefits of the product/app.
- Personalized engagement: Tailor content and notifications to individual user needs and preferences.
- Gathering user feedback: Actively solicit and respond to user feedback to identify pain points and areas for improvement.
- Incentivizing continued use: Implement loyalty programs or rewards to encourage users to return regularly.


What I used for analysis: **VLOOKUP, Pivot tables, product metrics, diagrams**
